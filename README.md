# SuperS
![alt text](https://static.thenounproject.com/png/421-200.png)
This project is driven from the idea of having a smart home.A smart home is
a house which is equipped with lighting, heating, and electronic devices that
can be controlled remotely either by a smart phone or a computer.In order to
turn the idea of smart home to reality, we need to have a number of sensors
in the house. Here comes our super sensor, our idea is to make a chip that
combines a various number of sensors in a small simple chip. A super sensor
can be used to gather all sort of information within its perimeter. So basically,
we have to place one in each room and cover the whole house, and then we
can easily monitor the status of the house like the temperature, number of
people in the house or even control the functions of some electronics like turn
a device on or off.
